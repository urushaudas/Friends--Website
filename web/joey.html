			<h1>Joseph Francis Tribbiani (Joey)</h1>
			<p align="center ">
				Joseph Francis "Joey" Tribbiani, Jr. is a fictional character from the NBC sitcoms Friends and its spin-off Joey, and is portrayed by <b>Matt LeBlanc</b>.Joey was presumably born in 1967 or 1968 as he talks about being 13 in 1981.He comes from an Italian American family of eight children. He is an Italian-American struggling actor who used to live in New York City with his roommate and best friend, Chandler Bing, and used to hang out in a tight-knit group of his best friends - Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Monica Geller-Bing, Rachel Green and Phoebe Buffay. He lived with a few other roommates when Chandler Bing moved out to move in with Monica Geller-Bing. Joey finally moved to LA to focus on his career after his best friends moved on with their own lives.<br>Joey is a stereotypical actor: oversexed, under-educated, and constantly looking for work. He is also ordained as a minister in, "The One With The Truth About London", and he officiates at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings. It is revealed in, "The One After 'I Do'" that Joey has a size seven foot, which he is secretive and defensive about. He also has a soft toy penguin named Huggsy.

			<p align="justify">
				Since the very beginning of Friends, Joey and Chandler proved they had the friendship of all friendships, even when Chandler kissed Kathy and when Joey got inside the entertainment center causing them to get robbed. Could there be two friends who loved each other more? The answer is no, because Joey and Chandler will forever be "best buds."<br>
				Joey spends one episode working with Chandler as an entry-level data processor. He treats the job like another acting role, in which he is "Joseph the Processing Guy" and creates a complex back-story for the character. Chandler begins to dislike the Joseph character when he starts showing up Chandler at work. Joey eventually leaves after Chandler pretends to sleep with Joey's "pretend wife".<br>
				Prior to Monica and Chandler's wedding, when the two admitted that they were having trouble finding someone to perform the ceremony, Joey volunteered for the role, subsequently getting himself ordained over the Internet to entitle him to perform the marriage. He has apparently retained this role until Season Ten, when he performed the ceremony for Phoebe and Mike's wedding, claiming that priests are allowed to ride the subway for free (Although he states that the Bible must be read very carefully to identify the passage that permits this).

			<h1>Joey TV series</h1>
			<p>
				After the 2003/2004 final season of Friends, Joey Tribbiani became the main character of Joey, a spin-off TV series, where he moved to L.A. to polish his acting career. His sister Gina Tribbiani and her son Michael (Paulo Costanzo) were two other central characters of the show.
				<br>
				Joey turned down a role in a sitcom called Nurses to star in a different series pilot. His pilot did not get picked up, while Nurses became a huge hit. However, his acting career has had some better moments. In Joey, it is revealed that Joey's character of Dr. Drake Ramoray died again on Days of our Lives where he is stabbed by a nurse ("Joey and the Wrong Name"). He won a Daytime Soap Award for "Best Death Scene". In later Joey episodes, Joey landed a starring role on the prime time soap Deep Powder. When he got fired from that job, he almost immediately bounced back by snagging a leading role in the big-budget action picture Captured.
