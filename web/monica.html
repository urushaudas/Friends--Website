			<h1>Monica E. Geller</h1>
			<p align="center ">
				Monica E. Geller is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appeared in the American sitcom Friends. Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and portrayed by actress <b>Courteney Cox</b>, Monica appears in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere on September 24, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. A chef known for her cleanliness, competitiveness and obsessive-compulsive nature, Monica is the younger sister of Ross and best friend of Rachel, the latter of whom she invites to live with her after Rachel forsakes her own wedding. The two characters spend several years living together as roommates until Monica begins a romantic relationship with long-time neighbor and friend Chandler, whom she marries. Unable to conceive children on their own, the couple eventually adopts twins and moves out of their apartment into a larger house in the suburbs.

			<h1>Family</h1>
			<p align="justify">
				Monica has a complicated relationship with her parents Jack (Elliot Gould) and Judy Geller (Christina Pickles), more-so with her mother. Entertainment Weekly referred to the character's relationship with her parents as "esteem-sucking." In fact, the majority of Friends main characters have "strained relationships" with their parents. Described as "hypercritical," Judy enjoys constantly criticizing her daughter's appearance, career, and love life, while acting much kinder towards her son, whom she favors. Chelsea Mize of Bustle wrote that Monica and Ross' "wacky quirks become all the more understandable after ... seeing them with their parents." Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2010 author Vincent Terrance believes that Monica's competitiveness originates from having grown up with Ross as a brother, against whom she often competed as a child Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive described Monica and Ross' relationship as "A blend of love and sibling jealousy with an urge to irritate each other to the deepest core of existence", with Ross often making fun of his sister's weight and Monica teasing him about his several failed marriages in return. In terms of ethnicity, Crane confirmed that both Monica and Ross are half-Jewish, with their father being Jewish and their mother being of non-Jewish European ancestry. However, Television's Changing Image of American Jews categorized Monica as a "masked" Jew, explaining that "the smart, funny, and insecure Ross seems more Jewish" than Monica, who the author dismissed as "china-doll like" in appearance and demeanor. In his book Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, Volume 1, author Stephen Harlan Norwood agrees that, unlike the show's male Jews, Monica's Jewish "markers" have been virtually removed.

			<h1>Monica & Rachel</h1>
			<p>
				Monica and Rachel were the ultimate dynamic duo. From Rachel's first real job to Monica's wedding to Rachel's baby, these two were there for all of the important moments.<br>There is nothing better than lifelong friends who have gone through all the awkward transitions of life. Rachel and Monica loved each other from the get-go. They were friends before Rachel's new nose, before Monica lost all the weight, and before the inception of the Friends gang. They have endless amounts of dirt on each other and their friendship has withstood the fictional test of time.<br>Rachel and Monica had some hilarious fights over the course of Friends, but they were always able to bounce back and laugh about it later.
