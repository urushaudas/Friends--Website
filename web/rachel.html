			<h1>Rachel Karen Green</h1>
			<p align="center ">
				Rachel Karen Green is a fictional character, one of the six main characters who appeared in the American sitcom Friends. Portrayed by actress <b>Jennifer Aniston</b>, the character was created by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and appeared in each of the show’s 236 episodes during its decade-long run, from its premiere on September 22, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. Introduced in the show's pilot as a naive runaway bride who reunites with her childhood best friend Monica and relocates to New York City, Rachel gradually evolves from a spoiled, inexperienced "daddy's girl" into a successful businesswoman. During the show's second season, the character becomes romantically involved with her friend Ross, with whom she maintains a complicated on-again, off-again relationship throughout the entire series. Together, the characters have a daughter, Emma

			<h1>Rachel & Ross</h1>
			<p align="justify">
				Prior to becoming a couple, Ross and Rachel were close friends, often confiding one another about their past relationships. Rachel and Ross are considered to be among television's greatest and most beloved couples.<br>
				After Ross and Rachel's break up, there were many hints that they would eventually reunite forever, especially seasons 8-10. In the final season, Rachel wants to sleep with Ross when her father has a heart attack and wants "sympathy sex", which he turns down, not wanting to take advantage of her in the state she is in. However, Ross and Rachel do sleep together again the night before she leaves for Paris, which results in him admitting he still loves her and wants to get back together in the series finale. Rachel turns down the Paris job in order to be with Ross when she realizes she still loves him too, and the two agree "this is it", getting back together for good.

			<h1>Career</h1>
			<p>
				We were first introduced to Rachel in a soaking wet wedding dress after fleeing her wedding. She cut up the credit cards that promised financial support from her father and immediately found work as a waitress. Pouring coffee and taking orders didn’t come easily.<br>Rachel quit Central Perk to pursue a career in fashion. With help from Joey, she found a job as a personal assistant at Fortunata Fashions.<br>After meeting Mark from Bloomingdale’s at the Moondance Diner, Rachel gets a job as an assistant buyer. In an unexpected chain of events, Mark resigns, her boss dies, Rachel’s department gets shut down, and she’s demoted to personal shopper.<br>Impressed by Rachel’s hard work and passion for fashion, Ralph Lauren promoted her to merchandising manager. This job gave her an assistant, but she goes against her gut instinct and employs a handsome young man with no experience ahead of a woman who can clearly do the job. To make matters worse she’s later fired after her boss overhears an interview for a job at Gucci.
