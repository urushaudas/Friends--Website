			<h1>Chandler Bing</h1>
			<p align="center ">
				Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by<b> Matthew Perry</b>. He was born on April 8, 1968, to Nora Tyler Bing (Morgan Fairchild), a romance novelist, and Charles Bing (Kathleen Turner), a gay female impersonator who later had a sex change operation and became the star of a Las Vegas drag show called “Viva Las Gay-gas”. He is of Scottish and Swedish ancestry. He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family. Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood. It is revealed in season 1 he went to an all-boys high school.<br>Though Chandler never lets up by using sarcasm as a defense, he had a tendency to come off as needy and makes bad first impressions as said by Phoebe with his constant joke-making and brash demeanor. Despite this emotional immaturity, Chandler is the most financially secure of his friends.

			<h1>Chandler & Monica</h1>
			<p align="justify">
				Chandler is afraid of commitment and had the fewest relationships out of all the Friends. Despite all this, he is the first one to have a committed marriage that doesn't end in divorce.<br>
				At Ross' wedding in London, Monica Geller <b>(Courteney Cox)</b> and Chandler decide to begin dating. They try to keep their relationship secret, as they are unsure about how the others would react. Eventually, however, they all find out. Their wedding is officiated by Joey, who is ordained over the Internet. In the final episode, Monica and Chandler adopt twins, due to their inability to conceive.<br>
				Monica's bossiness, neatness and overly competitive nature forces Chandler into several situations, such as her being unable to throw a game of tennis against Chandler's boss and Chandler hiding the fact that he is incredibly good at ping-pong so Monica won't enter them in doubles tournaments.

			<h1>Chandler & Thanksgiving</h1>
			<p>
				Thanksgiving was always an important episode for the series. Chandler's most vivid memory of Thanksgiving is when he was nine years old when his mother and father told him that they were getting divorced so his father could run off with the house-boy. Because of this, Chandler refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving in the traditional way. This includes a ban on all Thanksgiving food, as he insists that it's not as good after seeing a Thanksgiving dinner in reverse. His Thanksgiving dinner consists of tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, and a family-size bag of Funyuns. Several Thanksgiving episodes include retellings of this backstory of Chandler's home life and his hatred of the holiday. Joey goes so far as to say, "It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!" Later on, perhaps thanks to his more positive view of family events due to his relationship with Monica, he accepts Thanksgiving. He still refuses to eat the actual food, even when dining with his friends, eating chicken instead of turkey and other things of that nature.
