			<h1>Ross E. Geller</h1>
			<p align="center ">
				Ross Eustace Geller, Ph.D., is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by <b>David Schwimmer</b>. Ross is considered by many to be the most intelligent member of the group and is noted for his goofy but lovable demeanor. His relationship with Rachel Green was included in TV Guide's list of the best TV couples of all time, as well as Entertainment Weekly's "30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples". Kevin Bright, one of the executive producers of the show had worked with Schwimmer before, so the writers were already developing Ross’s character in Schwimmer’s voice. And hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show.

			<h1>Relationships</h1>
			<p align="justify">
				Carol is Ross's first wife and the mother of his son Ben. In the very first episode, Carol has just moved out of their apartment after coming out of the closet as a lesbian and leaving Ross for a woman named Susan Bunch, who she later marries.<br>During the fourth season, Ross meets and falls in love with Emily Waltham (Helen Baxendale), a British woman who is set up with Ross by Rachel. Ross spontaneously asks Emily to move in with him. This escalates into a marriage proposal. The two plan a wedding in London, to which Rachel is invited.

				During the ceremony, Ross, upon seeing Rachel, has a slip of the tongue and says Rachel's name instead of Emily's during his vows. Emily is furious and exits her own marriage. She said that she will return only if Ross stops being friends with Rachel. Unable to do so, Ross ends his marriage with Emily.<br>
				Rachel is Ross's most significant relationship during the series and also his thrid wife. His attraction to her is established early on; Ross met Rachel through his sister Monica, who was Rachel's best friend in high school. He developed an unrequited crush on her, but never followed through on it. After leaving college, Ross married Carol, whom he had met at college, and had seemingly put his feelings for Rachel aside before he met her again in The Pilot.

			<h1>Children</h1>
			<p align="justify">Carol tells Ross that she is pregnant with his child, and is having the baby with her partner Susan, though she wishes Ross to be part of the baby's life. Carol and Susan are often bemused by Ross' quirks throughout his onscreen appearances with them. Susan does not attempt to hide her contempt of Ross and vice versa, but they briefly put aside their differences when Carol gives birth to a boy, whom they all agree, after weeks of argument, to name<b> Ben</b>.<br>
				<b>Emma Geller-Green</b>: Rachel and Ross' infant daughter. Though Rachel had originally wanted to name her daughter "Isabella," she wound up in tears when she decided that the name did not suit her and was dismayed by her other remaining choice, Delilah Monica graciously suggests "Emma," the name she had chosen for her own future daughter when she was fourteen, but concedes that since "Nothing goes with 'Bing', so I'm screwed," so Rachel can give the name to her own daughter.
